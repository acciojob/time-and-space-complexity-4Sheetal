    <h1>Understanding Time and Space Complexity</h1>

    <p>
        Time complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the input size. 
        It is a crucial factor in determining how efficient an algorithm is. The lower the time complexity, 
        the more efficient the algorithm will be, especially when handling large data sets.

    <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses in relation to the input size. 
        It helps to understand how much memory resources are required during the execution of an algorithm. 
        For example, an algorithm with a space complexity of O(n) means that the memory usage grows linearly 
        with the input size.
